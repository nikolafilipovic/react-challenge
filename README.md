## How to use this repo

Make sure to install the dependencies using `npm install` beforehand.

To start the frontend & backend use `npm start`.

The frontend uses `create-react-app` as dev tool. All requests to `/api/*` are
proxied to `http://localhost:3001/` which is the port the backend listens on.
